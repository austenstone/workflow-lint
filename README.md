# Workflow Lint üßπ

Lint GitHub Actions workflow files using [`cschleiden/github-actions-parser`](https://github.com/cschleiden/github-actions-parser).

## Usage
Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/seat-count.yml`). See [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

<!-- 
### PAT(Personal Access Token)

You will need to [create a PAT(Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=admin:org) that has `admin:org` access.

Add this PAT as a secret so we can use it as input `github-token`, see [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). 
### Organizations

If your organization has SAML enabled you must authorize the PAT, see [Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).
